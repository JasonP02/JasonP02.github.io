## Overview
Developed a complete SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system
from the ground up in Python, moving beyond the standard ROS abstractions
used in robotics competitions to gain deeper understanding of the underlying
principles.

## Technical Details
• Implementation of core SLAM algorithms
• Bundle adjustment optimization
• Feature detection and matching
• Path planning algorithms
• Performance optimization techniques

## Key Learnings
• Complex Python project architecture
• Data pipeline management
• Optimization techniques
• Mathematical foundations of SLAM

## Challenges & Solutions
The main challenge was implementing efficient bundle adjustment for large-scale
mapping. This was addressed through careful algorithm optimization and the use
of sparse matrix operations, though some computational challenges remained.
