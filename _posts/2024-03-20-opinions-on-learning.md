## Why do we learn?

Before addressing what I think about learning, it is important to understand why we should learn at all. For most people, learning is a means to an end. We learn to get a job, to make money, to be successful, to be happy, etc.

This view is not wrong, but it is incomplete. Learning is a way for us to expand our worldview, and it is important that we learn so we can be better to one another.
