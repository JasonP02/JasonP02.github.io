## Overview
Design of a fail-safe shoe brake mechanism that activates during power failure scenarios. The system utilizes spring energy balanced by a solenoid during normal operation, ensuring immediate braking response during power loss.

## Technical Details
• Fail-safe mechanism design
• Spring force calculations
• Solenoid selection and integration
• Complete mechanical assembly
• Budget-conscious component selection
