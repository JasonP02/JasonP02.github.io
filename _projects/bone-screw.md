## Overview
Modification and analysis of a pediatric bone screw design based on the HA 6.5 standard. Project involved both CAD modeling and finite element analysis, with validation against experimental data.

## Technical Details
• SolidWorks screw profile design.
• ANSYS simulation setup and analysis.
• Experimental validation using Instron machine.
• Modification of diameter and pitch parameters.
• Stress and strain analysis.

I was the sole person in my group who did the FEA, so I had to learn how to use ANSYS on my own. It was a bit challenging at first, but I got the hang of it after many hours of trial and error with meshes. The primary goal was matching the simulation results to the experimental results. Here is a plot of the simulation results.

## Key Learnings
• Medical device design principles.
• FEA simulation techniques.
• Experimental validation methods.
• CAD modeling best practices.

## Challenges & Solutions
The primary challenge was ensuring accurate correlation between simulation and experimental results. This was addressed through careful model preparation and validation against Instron machine data.
