## Overview
Analysis of a semiconductor wafer manufacturing process using statistical methods to determine process control status. The project involved analyzing over 20 features through principal component analysis and Hotelling T² statistics.

## Technical Details
• Data cleaning and preprocessing
• PCA for dimensionality reduction (95% variance threshold)
• Hotelling T² statistical analysis
• Process control monitoring
• Data unfolding for time-series features
