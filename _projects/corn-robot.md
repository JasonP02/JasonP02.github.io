## Key Learnings
• Robotics system integration
• Environmental considerations
• Mechanical design principles
• Autonomous navigation

## Challenges & Solutions
The largest challenges were not being able to order our parts early! I learned the valuable importance of being able to get started on a project and build fast.
The hardest engineering challenge was serial communication and electrical interference issues that we resolved by many hours of begugging and testing different parts of the system
