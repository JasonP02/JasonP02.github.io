## Overview
Development of an autonomous robot for monitoring corn plants in a greenhouse. Used for research purposes by the Bartlett Lab at UMass Amherst.

## Technical Details
• Autonomous movement system design.

• Data collection pipeline for remote image access.

• Robust mechanical design done in Solid Works.

• Custom coupler mechanism for vertical movement.

• Rotating base design for multi-angle imaging.


### Coupler Mechanism
The coupler mechanism enables the stepper motor for x movement to be coupled to our lead screw for vertical movements. This was a collaborative design effort that required precise mechanical tolerances and careful consideration of load requirements.

### Rotating Base Design
The rotating base was implemented to capture multiple angles of plant data. Rather than implementing a more complex polar movement system or additional axis, we designed a rotating platform that the plant sits on. This solution enables data capture from multiple angles, particularly useful when leaves occlude the camera view.

## Challenges & Solutions
The largest challenges were not being able to order our parts early! I learned the valuable importance of being able to get started on a project and build fast.
The hardest engineering challenge was serial communication and electrical interference issues that we resolved by many hours of debugging and testing different parts of the system.
