## Overview
Analysis and implementation of a nonlinear energy harvesting system based on magnetic suspension, following research by Alevras et al. The project involved studying chaotic behaviors and bifurcations in a magnetic energy harvester system.

### What is a bifurcation?
Bifurcations are a primary object of study in nonlinear dynamics. These are plots that tell us how stable our system is, and is useful for seeing when a system will undergo some critical change. For this project, bifurcation would be the transition from the magnet moving to stopping.

## Technical Details
• Nonlinear system modeling.

• Chaotic behavior analysis.

• Bifurcation studies.

• Numerical analysis implementation.

• Secondary Sprott system J investigation.


The bifurcation study was the most challenging part of the project. I had to implement a numerical method to find the fixed points of the system and then use a bifurcation analysis to find the bifurcations. Here is one example of a bifurcation diagram I generated:

## Key Learnings
• Nonlinear system analysis.

• Chaos theory applications.

• Numerical methods.

• Research paper implementation.


## Challenges & Solutions
The main challenge was accurately reproducing the complex dynamics described in the original research paper. This was addressed through careful implementation of numerical methods and validation against published results.
