## Overview
Developed a complete SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system
from the ground up in Python, moving beyond the standard ROS abstractions
used in robotics competitions to gain deeper understanding of the underlying
principles.

## Technical Details
• Implementation of core SLAM algorithms
• Bundle adjustment optimization
• Feature detection and matching
• Loop closure detection
• Performance optimization techniques
• Complex data processing and storage pipeline

## Key Learnings
• Complex Python project architecture
• Data pipeline management
• Optimization techniques
• Mathematical foundations of SLAM

## Challenges & Solutions
The main challenge was implementing efficient bundle adjustment for large-scale
mapping. I had a lot of trouble deciding how to decide what data to keep since the end goal of this project was to run this on a PI. In the end, I got busy with other things an did not finish this project. Loop closure and BA is tough!
