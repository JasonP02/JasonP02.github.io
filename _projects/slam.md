## Overview
Developed a complete SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system from the ground up in Python, moving beyond the standard ROS abstractions used in robotics competitions to gain deeper understanding of the underlying principles.

## Technical Details
• Implementation of core SLAM algorithms.
• Bundle adjustment optimization.
• Feature detection and matching.
• Loop closure detection.
• Performance optimization techniques.
• Complex data processing and storage pipeline.

## Key Learnings
• Complex Python project architecture.
• Data pipeline management.
• Optimization techniques.
• Mathematical foundations of SLAM.

## Challenges & Solutions
The main challenge was implementing efficient bundle adjustment for large-scale mapping. The project focused on optimizing data storage and processing for Raspberry Pi deployment, though implementation of loop closure remains incomplete.
