## Overview
A collection of various design projects completed during my academic career. These are all small projects that I estimate I could complete within a couple of hours. I figured why not throw them on here.

## Projects

### Dresser Design
A dresser in my house. It is dimensionally accurate except for the fillets.

### Bridge Analysis
From Sophmore year in college. This was for my Statics class, and I would make something a lot nicer now!

### Phone Holder
We had to design and fabricate a phone holder. Useful introduction to 'thinking about manufacturability' for parts you make!
