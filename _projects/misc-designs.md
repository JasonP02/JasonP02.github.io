## Overview
A collection of various design projects completed during my academic career. These projects demonstrate practical applications of mechanical design principles.

## Projects

### Dresser Design
A dresser design with dimensionally accurate modeling except for the fillets.

### Bridge Analysis
From Sophomore year in college. This was a structural analysis project for Statics class.

### Phone Holder
A phone holder design and fabrication project focusing on manufacturability principles.
