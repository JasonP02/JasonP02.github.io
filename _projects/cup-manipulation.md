## Overview
Two-semester research project at the [Intelligent Sensing Lab](https://websites.umass.edu/xiandu/) at UMass Amherst focused on autonomous manipulation of water-filled cups using the LoCoBot platform. Sadly there was a fire in the lab, and I transitioned to a [different project with deep learning](https://jasonp02.github.io/projects/graph-neural-network/).

## Technical Details
• Implemented ROS control systems.
• Developed computer vision pipeline.
• Created trajectory planning algorithms.
• Liquid dynamics adjustment algorithm with PID.

## Key Learnings
• Deep understanding of ROS architecture.
• Computer vision pipeline development.
• Robot control system implementation.
• Linux system administration.

## Challenges & Solutions
The primary challenge was achieving reliable liquid handling without spills. This was addressed through careful trajectory planning and the development of specialized control algorithms that accounted for liquid dynamics. In the end, there was not enough time to finish things.
