## Overview
Development of a Human Machine Interface (HMI) system integrated with Allen Bradley PLC, designed to operate under specific operational constraints and requirements. This was the culmination of a semester long 'concrete pouring process' that we were implementing. A lot of self learning, and some fun ;)

## Technical Details
• Allen Bradley PLC programming
• HMI interface design
• System constraint implementation
• Full operational testing
• Video documentation of working system

## Key Learnings
• Industrial automation practices
• HMI design principles
• PLC programming
• System integration

## Challenges & Solutions
The main challenge was ensuring reliable communication between the HMI and PLC while meeting all operational constraints. This was resolved through careful system design and thorough testing procedures.
